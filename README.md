# final-project-games

This is our final project for the end of the one year course for Web Development at DCI
The link provided will lead to the project manager's repository to which me and the other two collegues have contributed and collaborated on.
This game has been developed by Fred Bolder, first programmed in Turbo Pascal for DOS and later in C# for Windows. 
During the period of time alocated for this last project we all collaborated in developing it in React + Vite. 
Any changes made after mid-January 2024 are his alone.
